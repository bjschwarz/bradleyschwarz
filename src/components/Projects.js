I am interested in exploring the design of how candle light was optimized and made beautiful in times past. They were the main source of lighting at tables and in large rooms for hundreds of years."

        description: "This was my first attempt at chasing and repousse in steel. Moving cold steel by hand and hammer is much different than non-ferrous metals. I learned that I needed a bigger hammer with more force and frequent annealing to keep the metal soft enough to work. It gave me an appreciation for medieval armor smiths. I originally designed this to become a door knocker and I eventually will complete it."

        description: "This hook was inspired by early medieval Gothic-era ironwork, specifically the hinges of the Notre Dame Cathedral. I wanted to develop the process of creating these botanical motifs, using some of the same ancient techniques, to use on more complex future work. There is an elegance and mastery to these shapes that I am only scratching the surface of."

        description: "We are fond of using candles for light in our household. Taking the candles off surfaces where children and animals can reach them makes it much safer. Since wall mounted candles have been used for centuries I don't think we are the first to have seen the benefit. The inspiration for this design came from a similar one made by mentor and fellow smith Tom Latané. I loved the extreme material isolation and the integrated candle cup. "
