I was inspired by the gothic-esque leafs on the andirons at the Biltmore estate. I liked the simplicity of the central stem. It made an elegant leaf without getting distracted by minute details. I took this idea further and made the stem become the base of the hook, Terminated in an acorn."

Specifically, I liked the integrated dragon head legs. This detail provided an opportunity to try solid steel chasing. The project was a combination of sculpture and geometrical design. The candelabra/candle stick was the main source of light at tables and rooms for hundreds of years. I am interested in exploring the design of how candle light was optimized and made beautiful in times past."

Tools have always been an extension of the hand for craftsmen. I enjoy making tools beautiful in addition to functioning well. Tools made with this intention are a joy to use, and are often the ones kept for centuries."
