I found inspiration for the project in gothic-style leaves on the andirons at the Biltmore Estate. I appreciated their simplicity of the central stems. The simple stems made for an elegant leaf free of distraction. The stem then curves to make the base of the hook and terminates in an acorn. "

I was drawn immediately to the integrated dragon head legs. This detail provided an opportunity to try solid steel chasing. The project was a combination of sculptural and geometrical design. I am interested in exploring the design of how candle light was optimized and made beautiful in times past. They were the main source of lighting at tables and in large rooms for hundreds of years."

Additionally, I referenced an image of a similar compass in the book Decorative Antique Ironwork by Henry Rene D'Allemagne. This was a challenging project since I first had to learn the proper process of forging a mechanically-sound compass. Tools have always been an extension of the hand for craftsmen. I enjoy making tools beautiful in addition to functional. Tools made with this intention are a joy to use."

I decided it was an excellent opportunity to bring back the old mentality of beautiful form and function. I used proportional geometry to do all of the layout for this piece. "
