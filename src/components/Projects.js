This process would have been similar to how they would have accomplished this in ancient times."

I was inspired by the gothic esque leafs on the andirons at the Biltmore estate. I liked the simplicity of the central stem. I took this idea further and made the stem become the base of the hook. Terminated in an acorn."

I specifically liked the integrated dragon head legs. The project was a combinated of sculpture and geometrical design which I am drawn to. The candelabra/candle stick was the main source of light at tables and rooms for hundreds of years. I am interested in exploring the design of how candle light was optimized and made beautiful in times past."

I also saw an image of similar dividers in the book Decorative Antique Ironwork. This was a challenging project. Since I first had to learn the proper process of making simple dividers. Tools have always been an extension of the hand for craftsman. I enjoy making tools beautiful in addition to functioning well. Tools made with this intention are a joy to use, and are often the ones kept for centuries."
