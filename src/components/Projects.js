Unfortunately I punched through the brass in a couple places since I had not learned the limitations of the medium or the importance of having tools with all smooth edges. Nevertheless I really enjoyed this project and it inspired me to continue doing repousse work."

It gave me an appreciation for medieval armor smiths. I originally designed this to become a door knocker and I eventually will complete it."

The inspiration for this design came from a similar one made by mentor and fellow smith Tom Latané. I loved the extreme material isolation and the integrated candle cup. "
